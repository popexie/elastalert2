# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Due to the small team maintaining this project only the latest release is supported. However, 
breaking changes are rare with this project's releases and so typically there should be no
reason to not upgrade to the latest release.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| >= 2.22 | :white_check_mark: |
| <= 2.21  | :x:                |
| 1.x     | :x:                |


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found an urgent vulnerability, please send an email to 
security@elastalert.com with sufficient information to reproduce the problem.

A response can be expected within 24 hours, however there may be situations
where a response may take a couple of days. If no response is received within 2-3 
days there may be an issue with email transmission. The secondary contact 
method is to send the project maintainer a direct message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jertel/).
